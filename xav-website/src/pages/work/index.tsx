        I work at Northcoders as a software engineer and team lead on a dev
        incubator project. That means that I'm outsourced to an external client,
        where I lead a team of software engineers. It works a bit like
        contracting/consultancy. I write less code than I used to.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've also worked to a SaaS model and done agency-style and freelance
        work. I don't have much of a preference, I think you can develop good
        software in any context.
        <br />
        <br />I code in my own time, and haven't yet turned any personal
        projects into big glossy portfolio pieces. I don't feel too bad about
        that, I enjoy my life away from my laptop. I like cooking, camping,
        cycling and BJJ.
