        I work at Northcoders as a software engineer and team lead on a dev
        incubator project. That means that I'm outsourced to an external client,
        where I lead a team of software engineers. I write less code than I used
        to, but I really enjoy the planning side of the job (as long as
        everything goes perfectly, which it always does).

        I've worked to a SaaS model, done agency-style and freelance work. I
        like working in multi-disciplinary teams, and will seek exposure to any
        part of a business that can inform my understanding of the product(s)
        I'm working on. I'm good under pressure but don't seek it out.
        <br />
        <br />I code in my own time, and haven't yet turned any personal
        projects into big glossy portfolio pieces. I don't feel too bad about
        that, I enjoy my life away from my laptop. I like cooking, hiking,
        cycling and BJJ.
