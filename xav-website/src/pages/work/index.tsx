      Hold your horses, a CMS hookup is coming and I'll talk about some projects
      at that point.
      <br />

      In the mean time, this is roughly how I did this website:
      <br />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>Testing</li>
        <li>Flutter</li>
        <li>BJJ</li>
        <li>React tooling</li>
        <li>How I fucking hate javascript</li>
        <li>Games that make me feel alive</li>
        <li>The Industry</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Work;
